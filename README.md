### About me
I am a mathematician, computer scientist, and convex optimization expert with a strong record of tackling computationally demanding problems across interdisciplinary fields. During my Ph.D. at Stanford University, I accelerated the reconstruction of metabolic networks comprising tens of thousands of reactions by 30 times, significantly advancing the efficiency of systems biology modeling.

In recent years, I have contributed extensively to solving high-dimensional and computationally intensive optimization problems. I enhanced the functionality of the widely used [COBRA toolbox](https://opencobra.github.io/) and served as a moderator for [COBRA.jl](https://github.com/opencobra/COBRA.jl), fostering collaboration and innovation within the community. My recent collaborations include initiatives like [ProtPy](https://aapm.confex.com/aapm/2023am/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/4208) and [CompressRTP](https://portpy-project.github.io/CompressRTP/), the latter addressing radiotherapy treatment planning problems involving optimization over 100,000 variables. This work, published in *NeurIPS 2024*, achieved substantial computational efficiency improvements, addressing challenges critical to clinical workflows.

Additionally, I organized a nationwide optimization contest during my first year at university, which focused on solving highly non-convex and high-dimensional optimization problems. My dedication to open science and decentralized science (DeSci) has shaped my approach to collaborative efforts, aligning with my broader goal of democratizing scientific research through open access to tools and knowledge.
