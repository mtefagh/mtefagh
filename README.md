### About me
I am a mathematician, computer scientist, and convex optimization expert with a track record of modeling computationally demanding problems in interdisciplinary fields. For example, in my Ph.D. at Stanford, I sped up the reconstruction of metabolic networks of tens of thousands of reactions by 30 times. In the last few years, I have dedicated my efforts to developing subroutines for the [COBRA toolbox](https://opencobra.github.io/) and also served as a moderator for [COBRA.jl](https://github.com/opencobra/COBRA.jl), both of which are optimization tools used in systems biology. Recently, I teamed up with collaborators from MSKCC to work on a new initiative called [ProtPy](https://aapm.confex.com/aapm/2023am/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/4208), which is a similar open standard aimed at optimization techniques for improving radiotherapy treatment planning. Although it is still in its early stages, I am thrilled to be a part of it.
Apart from my involvement in COBRA and ProtPy, I organized a nationwide optimization contest during my first year at university. The contest focused on a systems biology [problem](http://optimizer.math.sharif.edu/Optimizer2021.pdf) and was tailored to research-oriented individuals.
I am particularly passionate about the concept of open science and decentralized science (DeSci). I have discovered that collective efforts within the scientific community align perfectly with my past experiences and interests.
