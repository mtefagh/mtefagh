### About me
For the past few years, I have been engaged in the development of subroutines for the [COBRA toolbox](https://opencobra.github.io/) and have been a moderator of [COBRA.jl](https://github.com/opencobra/COBRA.jl). Very recently, I and some collaborators from MSKCC are collaborating on an initiative to build a similar open standard for optimization tools used in radiotherapy treatment planning, named [ProtPy](https://github.com/PortPy-Project/PortPy), which is in its very early stages. Moreover, I organized a research-oriented nation-wide optimization contest with a systems biology [problem](http://optimizer.math.sharif.edu/Optimizer2021.pdf) in the first year of my career at university. I am very interested in open science and have found such collective efforts in the scientific community very aligned with my prior background and interests.
